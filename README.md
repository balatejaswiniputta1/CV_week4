This project detects the boundary of an animal in a thermal image using classical OpenCV techniques (grayscale conversion, contrast enhancement, Otsu thresholding, and morphological operations) without any machine learning. The extracted contour was compared with SAM2 deep learning segmentation, achieving strong agreement with IoU = 0.947 and Dice = 0.973, demonstrating that traditional image processing can perform comparably well in high-contrast thermal scenarios.
